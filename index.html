    <h1>Startup PESTLE Challenge</h1>
    <h2>Welcome to LSST Learning Simulations</h2>
    
    <p><strong>What is PESTLE Analysis?</strong></p>
    <p>
      PESTLE stands for Political, Economic, Social, Technological, Legal and Environmental analysis. It is a strategic tool used to understand the external environment in which your business operates. For startups, a good PESTLE analysis helps you:
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li>Identify opportunities and threats in the market</li>
      <li>Understand customer and competitor dynamics</li>
      <li>Plan for future trends and challenges</li>
    </ul>
    
    <p><strong>Understanding Key Metrics</strong></p>
    
    <h2>Strategic Insight</h2>
    <p>
      This is basically understanding what’s happening in your market and industry.<br>
      Think of it like having a good map before starting a journey. For startups, it means:
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li>Knowing what your customers really want</li>
      <li>Understanding who your competitors are and what makes you different</li>
      <li>Seeing where your industry is heading before everyone else does</li>
    </ul>
    
    <h2>Decision Effectiveness</h2>
    <p>
      This is about making good choices quickly and actually following through with them. For startups, it’s important because:
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li>You usually do not have much money or time to waste on wrong decisions</li>
      <li>You need to move fast but also think things through</li>
      <li>Early mistakes can be really hard to fix when your business is just starting</li>
    </ul>
    
    <h2>Risk Mitigation</h2>
    <p>
      This is about spotting possible problems early and having a plan to handle them. For new businesses, this matters because:
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li>New companies can get hurt easily by unexpected problems</li>
      <li>It helps you avoid wasting your limited money</li>
      <li>It shows investors you have thought about what could go wrong and have a backup plan</li>
    </ul>
    
    <p>
      Think of these three working together like this: Strategic insight is like choosing the right road to take, decision effectiveness is about driving well on that road, and risk mitigation is like having insurance and a spare tyre for the journey.
